        <h1>This is a minimal website.</h1>
        <aside>And it's perfect.</aside>
    </header>
        
        <h2>Seriously, what do you want on a website?</h2>
        
        <p>You probably build websites and think they're special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills make IE7 feel amazing because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, dummy. Let me describe your perfect website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>It's lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all screens perfectly</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all browsers</li>
            <li>It's accessible to everyone that visits your site</li>
            <li>It's legible and gets your point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Guess what:</h3>
        
        <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this. It's a website. Why do you need to animate a trendy banner flag when I hover over it? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your site, and some person jabbing at it on their iPad with fat fingers will never see it. Not to mention blind people will never see that either, but they don't see any of your site in the first place.</p>
        
        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
        
        <h2>It's lightweight</h2>
        
        <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? How could you.</p>
        
        <h2>It's responsive</h2>
        
        <p>You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a Tamagotchi.</p>
        
        <h2>It works</h2>
        
        <p>Look at this. You can read it ... that is, if you can read. It makes sense. It has hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your browser know what is in this site. That's semantics.</p>
        
        <p>It has content on the screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
        
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this site in IE6. I dare you.</p>
        
        <h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>
        
        <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are skeuomorphic degenerations of what should be text communicating a message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's beautiful.</p>
        
        <h3>Yes, this is satire</h3>
        
        <p>I'm not actually saying your site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them.</p>

    <p>From the philosophies expressed (poorly) above, <a href="http://txti.es">txti</a> was created. You should try it today to make your own minimal websites.</p>
